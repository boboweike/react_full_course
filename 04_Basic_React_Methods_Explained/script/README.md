Now that we've learned the basic usage of React, next, we'll delve into a detailed explanation of the two methods we've been using.

First up is the `React.createElement` method. For this method, a general understanding is sufficient, there's no need to memorize it in detail. This method isn't particularly user-friendly and can become quite cumbersome when creating complex structures. Therefore, we'll be learning a more simplified and friendly syntax to create React elements in the future. However, there are some aspects of this method we haven't covered yet, so let's elaborate on those.

Alright, let's return to our code. We've previously discussed the parameters of this method. The first parameter represents the name of the React element, which corresponds to the name of the HTML tag. For instance, if it's `h1`, then we write `h1`. If we want to create a `p` tag, then here, you just need to write `p`. When we go back to the page and refresh it, you'll notice that the element has now become a `p` tag. So, the first parameter is quite straightforward.

Next, the second parameter represents the attributes of the element. Initially, we wrote `null` here, indicating no attributes. If you want to assign attributes, you can create an object here. Within this object, you can add attributes. For example, let's add a `title` attribute with the value "I am the title", and save it. Now, return to the page and refresh. Open the root div and you'll notice a title within this p tag. This is how you assign attributes. Of course, if you have additional attributes, you can continue to add them here. For example, let's add an `id` attribute with the value `p1`. Save it. Return to the page, and refresh. Now, it has two attributes. So, if there are attributes, just put them in the second parameter position.

So, the third parameter, as we've mentioned, represents the child node of the element. However, this isn't entirely accurate. To be precise, it's not limited to three parameters. In fact, it can have four, five, six, or even more parameters, and all parameters starting from the third represent its child nodes. Therefore, we should correct this: the third parameter and all subsequent parameters represent the child nodes of the element, as an element can indeed have multiple child nodes. For instance, we currently have a text node parameter. Now, we can add a new node to it, let's add another element node this time. But if its node is another element, how should we write it? Actually, we still need to use the `React.createElement` method to create a new element. For example, I want it to have a `span` element, so I write a `span`, it has no attributes, but it has content, let's write "This is a span node". Save it.

In this way, we've added another node to this `p` element. Let's see the effect. Go back to the page, refresh it, and you can see that the page displays new content. Let's look at the `root div`, you'll find that in the `p` tag, there is not only a text node but also a `span` node. This demonstrates the usage of its subsequent parameters. If you want to add more nodes, just continue to add them. However, we find that even though we only wrote a very simple HTML structure, which is a `p` tag nested with a `span`, we had to write a lot of such code. Therefore, the `React.createElement` method is not very convenient to use. So, all we need to do for this method is to understand it.

Another method is `ReactDOM.render`, which is a key method. However, it's actually quite simple, and we've already given a detailed explanation before. Let's take a quick look again. This method is responsible for rendering the `React` elements we've created onto the page. That is to say, its first parameter is the React element you've already created. For example, if I want to render the element `el` I've created onto the page, then I can just write `el` as the first parameter. Of course, we'll learn about components later. If you've learned about components and have created one, you can similarly rewrite this as a component parameter. We'll talk more about this later. The second parameter is a DOM object. That is, the location on the page where our created React element is rendered. In general, we write `document.getElementById` here to get a root node, which is our mount point. Finally, our element is rendered under the root node. This is the `React.render` method.

Alright, that's a simple explanation of these two methods. That's all we'll cover for now.
