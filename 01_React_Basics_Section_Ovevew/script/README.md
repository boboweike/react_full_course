Hello everyone, starting today, we're jumping right into learning React.

In this first section, we are going to explore the basics of React. Once we've got the basics, we are aiming to achieve the following goals:

- Firstly, we should be able to explain what React is
- Second, we should be able to tell the features of React
- Third, and this one is crucial, we should master the basic use of React
- Last but not least, we should be able to work with React's scaffolding tool, called create-react-app.

So, these are our targets for the React basics section.

Now, let's take a quick peek at our learning contents for this section.

We'll start with an overview of React. In this section, we'll understand what React is and what makes it stand out. Following that, we'll get down to the basics of using React. And Finally, we'll learn how to use the create-react-app scaffolding tool.

Alright, that sums up the main content of our React learning journey.
